    <string name="recipe1desc">This Persian stew of tomatoes and spiced eggplant is typically made with lamb or beef, but it’s faster and just as savory without meat. If you’re using dried limes, puncture them with a knife to further release their unique tangy and musky flavor into the stew. Lime juice isn’t a perfect substitute, but it adds a hit of much-needed, brightening acidity.
